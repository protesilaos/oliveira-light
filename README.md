# Oliveira light syntax theme

An experimental low-contrast theme for the Atom text editor. Also available as [a dark theme](https://github.com/protesilaos/oliveira-dark-syntax).

**Beware**. This project is still in early development.

*Oliveira* is inspired by [Ethan Schoonover's Solarized](http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized) theme.
